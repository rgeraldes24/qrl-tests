# Console suite

```bash
# Compile the live suite without running it.
go test -tags=e2e -run '^$' ./endtoend/suites/execution/console

# Regeneration requires `hypc --version` to report commit.2b9a0f1d.
go generate ./endtoend/suites/execution/console

# Run against an already-running development network.

## Coverage contract

The console suite targets behavior implemented by the embedded web3 wrapper,
not exhaustive raw RPC coverage.

Covered:

- Provider dispatch plus block, header, state, fee, receipt, namespace, chain
  ID, and QIP-55 wrapper behavior.
- Contract deployment through both raw submission and `ContractFactory.new`,
  pure and overloaded calls, payable and failed Clef-backed transactions,
  revert propagation, and canonical ABI-decoded Q-addresses.
- VM64 scalars, dynamic values, fixed-byte boundaries, fixed and dynamic
  arrays, and live nested arrays containing dynamic elements.
- Receipt logs, exact/wildcard/OR filters, generated indexed event filters and
  positive and negative matching, and WebSocket watches. Indexed values cover
  address, bool, signed and unsigned 512-bit integers, `bytes33`, string, and
  dynamic bytes.

Representative boundaries include values with non-zero upper 256 bits,
`bytes33`/`bytes64`, data crossing a 64-byte boundary, and full 64-byte topics.

Excluded:

- Exhaustive raw JSON-RPC behavior, covered by the API suite.
- Generated Go bindings and unsupported ABI classes, covered by the ABI suite.
- Direct node-managed `qrl_sendTransaction`, covered by the external signer
  suite.
- Node lifecycle and unsafe debug operations.
