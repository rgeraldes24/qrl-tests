# ABI suite

```bash
# Compile the complete suite without running live tests.
go test -tags=e2e -run '^$' ./endtoend/suites/execution/abi

# Regeneration requires `hypc --version` to report commit.2b9a0f1d.
go generate ./endtoend/suites/execution/abi

## Coverage contract

The target is 100% of documented supported feature classes: every class has
core ABI coverage, every Go representation is generated and compiled, and each
compiler/VM/RPC boundary has a representative live assertion. It is not a
promise to exercise every type-width and nesting cross-product or to reach 100%
statement coverage.

Covered:

- Deployment: dynamic constructor strings, bytes, tuples, and arrays, verified
  through the emitted constructor event.
- Calls: VM integer transition widths and extrema, booleans, 64-byte addresses,
  fixed bytes across the 32- and 64-byte boundaries, dynamic bytes and strings
  around 64-byte length boundaries, fixed and dynamic arrays, nested tuples,
  views, and overloaded methods.
- Errors: a complex custom error, `Error(string)`, `Panic(uint256)`, RPC revert
  data, and failed transaction receipts.
- Events and filters: successful transactions, scalar and composite events,
  supported indexed topics, overloaded events, and positive, negative,
  wildcard, and OR filters.
- Function values: two-word 68-byte values, dynamic offsets, callback
  execution, generated calls and events, and indexed hashing and filtering.
- Payable entrypoints: a named payable method plus distinct receive and
  fallback transactions.
- WebSocket subscriptions: generated watchers with matching and non-matching
  scalar and dynamically hashed indexed predicates.

Not currently supported and excluded from this target:

- Anonymous-event binding decoding and filtering.
- Composite indexed-topic construction and tuple reconstruction.
- Overloaded custom errors and generic `ABI.Unpack` error-name decoding.
- Anonymous tuple fields and unused fixed-point and hash ABI types.
- The upstream v2 binding API.
